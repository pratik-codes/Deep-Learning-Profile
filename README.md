# Deep_Learning_ProfileðŸ’¡
This repositry contains all my Deep Learning projects this helps the viewer to narrow down the projects by technology and to look at my most recent work.

## [Face Mask Dectiction System](https://github.com/pratiktiwari1212/Face_Mask_Detection)
- This project is implemented in Python using Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV. I used convolutional neural network for training. Idea of the projects popped during the times of covid -19 where wearining mask is very important for the safety of everyone. I thaught this particular project to be very usefull as this project can be implemented in usecases like

## I am currently working on more Deep Learning Projects hence those will come very soon...
